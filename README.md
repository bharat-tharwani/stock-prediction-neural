# Project Overview

<h5>Effectiveness of LSTM Models in Time Series Forecasting</h5>

This project explores the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in forecasting time series data.
We focus on two case studies: </br>
• Forecasting the closing price of Amazon stock</br>
• Predicting random integers. </br>
Our objective is to assess the predictive accuracy and model behavior in diverse scenarios.

<h5>Result:</h5>
